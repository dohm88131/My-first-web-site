    <p>Transfemoral cerebral angiography <strong>uses a catheter, x-ray imaging guidance and an injection of contrast material <u>to examine blood vessels in the brain</u></strong> for abnormalities such as aneurysms and disease such as atherosclerosis (plaque). The use of a catheter makes it possible to combine diagnosis and treatment in a single procedure. Cerebral angiography produces very detailed, clear and accurate pictures of blood vessels in the brain and may eliminate the need for surgery.</p><p> Your doctor will instruct you on how to prepare, including any changes to your medication schedule. Tell your doctor if there's a possibility you are pregnant and discuss any recent illnesses, medical conditions, medications you're taking, and allergies, especially to iodinated contrast materials. If you're breastfeeding, ask your doctor how to proceed. If you are to be sedated, you may be told not to eat or drink anything for four to eight hours before your procedure. Also, you should plan to have someone drive you home. Leave jewelry at home and wear loose, comfortable clothing. You will be asked to wear a gown.</p>
