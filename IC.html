    <br><br><br><br><h2>PCI : Percutaneous Coronary Intervention</h2>
    <p>Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is <strong>a non-surgical procedure used to <u>the blockages in a coronary artery;</u></strong> it opens up narrowed or blocked sections of the artery, restoring blood flow to the heart. The average heart beats 100,000 time per day, constantly pumping oxygen-rich blood into the arteries and onward to organs, muscles, and other tissues throughout the body. But the heart itself is a muscle, and like all the other tissues in the body, it also needs a steady supply of oxygen-rich blood to stay healthy and work properly. This blood is delivered to the heart by the coronary arteries.</p><p>Certain conditions can cause the coronary arteries to narrow or become blocked, restricting or blocking blood flow to the heart. For instance, in coronary artery disease - the most common type of heart disease in the U.S. - plaque deposits within the walls of the coronary arteries cause them to narrow, reducing blood flow and leading to chest pain and, in some cases, a heart attack. That’s where a treatment like percutaneous coronary intervention can be important. In the U.S., around 900,000 PCIs are performed every year.</p><p>"PCI is a non-surgical and minimally invasive method of treating coronary artery disease," says Yale Medicine interventional cardiologist Yousif Ahmad, BMBS, PhD. "In the setting of a heart attack, this is a life-saving treatment. For patients with stable coronary artery disease, it can also improve blood flow considerably, as well as relieve chest pain and shortness of breath. The procedure is typically performed through a small artery in the wrist, and our patients are usually discharged from hospital the same day or day after the procedure. Patients typically feel instantly better after PCI and go back to their normal daily routines without a long recovery time."</p>
