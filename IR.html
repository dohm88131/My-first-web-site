    <br><br><br><br><h2>TACE : Transarterial Chemo-Embolization</h2>
    <p>Transarterial chemoembolization or TACE <strong>places chemotherapy and synthetic materials called embolic agents into a blood vessel feeding a cancerous tumor <u>to cut off the tumor's blood supply and trap the chemotherapy within the tumor.</u></strong> It is most often used to treat liver cancer but may also be used in patients whose cancer has spread to other areas of the body. Chemoembolization may be used as a standalone treatment or in combination with surgery, ablation, chemotherapy or radiation therapy.</p><p style="margin-top:15px;">Your doctor will instruct you on how to prepare, including any changes to your medication schedule. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant and discuss any recent illnesses, medical conditions, allergies and medications you're taking, including herbal supplements and aspirin. Your doctor may advise you to stop taking aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or blood thinners several days prior to your procedure. They may also tell you not to eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. Plan to stay at the hospital overnight. Leave jewelry at home and wear loose, comfortable clothing. You may need to change into a gown for the procedure.</p>
