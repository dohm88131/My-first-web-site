    <p>Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is <strong>a non-surgical procedure used to <u>the blockages in a coronary artery;</u></strong> it opens up narrowed or blocked sections of the artery, restoring blood flow to the heart. The average heart beats 100,000 time per day, constantly pumping oxygen-rich blood into the arteries and onward to organs, muscles, and other tissues throughout the body. But the heart itself is a muscle, and like all the other tissues in the body, it also needs a steady supply of oxygen-rich blood to stay healthy and work properly. This blood is delivered to the heart by the coronary arteries.</p><p>Certain conditions can cause the coronary arteries to narrow or become blocked, restricting or blocking blood flow to the heart. For instance, in coronary artery disease - the most common type of heart disease in the U.S. - plaque deposits within the walls of the coronary arteries cause them to narrow, reducing blood flow and leading to chest pain and, in some cases, a heart attack. That’s where a treatment like percutaneous coronary intervention can be important. In the U.S., around 900,000 PCIs are performed every year.</p><p>"PCI is a non-surgical and minimally invasive method of treating coronary artery disease," says Yale Medicine interventional cardiologist Yousif Ahmad, BMBS, PhD. "In the setting of a heart attack, this is a life-saving treatment. For patients with stable coronary artery disease, it can also improve blood flow considerably, as well as relieve chest pain and shortness of breath. The procedure is typically performed through a small artery in the wrist, and our patients are usually discharged from hospital the same day or day after the procedure. Patients typically feel instantly better after PCI and go back to their normal daily routines without a long recovery time."</p>
    <h2>TFCA : Transfemoral Cerebral Angiography _ <a href="https://www.chosun.com/national/welfare-medical/2024/03/09/ZAFHAX7QKNDTPK3PYQX33N3U6I/" target="_blank" title="강릉아산병원 NS 양구현 교수님">related article</a></h2>
    <p>Transfemoral cerebral angiography <strong>uses a catheter, x-ray imaging guidance and an injection of contrast material <u>to examine blood vessels in the brain</u></strong> for abnormalities such as aneurysms and disease such as atherosclerosis (plaque). The use of a catheter makes it possible to combine diagnosis and treatment in a single procedure. Cerebral angiography produces very detailed, clear and accurate pictures of blood vessels in the brain and may eliminate the need for surgery.</p><p> Your doctor will instruct you on how to prepare, including any changes to your medication schedule. Tell your doctor if there's a possibility you are pregnant and discuss any recent illnesses, medical conditions, medications you're taking, and allergies, especially to iodinated contrast materials. If you're breastfeeding, ask your doctor how to proceed. If you are to be sedated, you may be told not to eat or drink anything for four to eight hours before your procedure. Also, you should plan to have someone drive you home. Leave jewelry at home and wear loose, comfortable clothing. You will be asked to wear a gown.</p>
    <h2>TACE : Transarterial Chemo-Embolization</h2>
    <p>Transarterial chemoembolization or TACE <strong>places chemotherapy and synthetic materials called embolic agents into a blood vessel feeding a cancerous tumor <u>to cut off the tumor's blood supply and trap the chemotherapy within the tumor.</u></strong> It is most often used to treat liver cancer but may also be used in patients whose cancer has spread to other areas of the body. Chemoembolization may be used as a standalone treatment or in combination with surgery, ablation, chemotherapy or radiation therapy.</p><p style="margin-top:15px;">Your doctor will instruct you on how to prepare, including any changes to your medication schedule. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant and discuss any recent illnesses, medical conditions, allergies and medications you're taking, including herbal supplements and aspirin. Your doctor may advise you to stop taking aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or blood thinners several days prior to your procedure. They may also tell you not to eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. Plan to stay at the hospital overnight. Leave jewelry at home and wear loose, comfortable clothing. You may need to change into a gown for the procedure.</p>
